# Robot
## Purpose
This repository was created to house the code for a robotics independent research course. 
## Goals of the project
1. Learn the basics of coding for Arduino.
2. Work on incorporating peripherals like servos, lights, and sensors
3. Implement use of servos to produce a robot that can autonomously navigate around obstacles
4. Use the knowledge gained in the prior 3 steps to create an autonomous quadraped.
